Hi Levi, hope you like what you see!

Directions:
1. Copy the .py files into your python ide project folder
2. install the necessary libraries (if its pycharm go to settings, project interpreter, click the plus, then search for library)
3. Once you have all the libraries run the file. 

Right now it should send you a late email, however the commented out test cases should send you each email type.
To test different dates, go to emailFunctions.py and to sendDates. there change today_date to whatever you like
If i had more time I would create an initialization batch file to install necessary 3rd party libraries
Libraries:
email
bs4
eml_parser
re
smtplib
datetime
